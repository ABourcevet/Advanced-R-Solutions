- integrate the preface into index.Rmd
- wichtig zu sagen, dass Malte damit angefangen hat?

## Introduction
This book provides solutions to the exercises offered in Advanced R (2nd Edition, Wickham, 2019) and reflects our effort to understand and acquire the content presented in it.

Advanced R covers R and programming. It presents the specific characteristics of the R language to programmers and helps R users to improve their understanding of general programming concepts. 

When we came across Advanced R we found, that it gave us a more thorough understanding of the R code we worked with daily and helped us see the underlying principles more clearly. The content helped us get a more complete picture/ map of the landscape of programming with R and was presented accessible and relevant way.

We soon re-discovered that reading about programming is not enough and that it's better to open the editor and write some code along the way. The clear structure of Advanced R and the exercises given provided a great starting point for this.

We took advantage of the `{bookdown}` package to structure this process and create a book almost as a by-product. The initial progress was fun and motivating. To actually provide solutions to all the 284 exercises in the book took us more time and Hadley's rewriting of Advanced R halfway didn't make it easier.



The solutions in this book are written from our personal perspective and level of understanding. We both come from quantitative backgrounds (mathematics/ statistics) preparing us more for data analysis than for programming. So we were R users first and improved as programmers in our day jobs and also through working on this project.



We consider this book as a **solutions manual**, which intends to supplement and support your study of the R language through Advanced R.
  - keep you motivated
  - check your understanding and progress
  - get another perspective on the material presented
- not a standalone book, you can it best use it together with Advanced R (as a hardcopy or on the website https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)

- doing the exercises yourself should give the biggest benefit.

- As the project matured we strived to provide solutions in a clean, straightforward, readable and exemplary manner. (as concise, consistent and expressive as possible)
- a lot of the solutions consist of mostly code. 
- code comes first, preference to lengthy explanations

- We tried to use prose to motivate the approaches taken and add useful information where appropriate
- The written explanations fill in context and motivation, discuss important implementation details or relate to the practical work of being an R programmer.

### How to work with this book
When we worked through the book we used the following strategies.
- It's good to start with the parts of Advanced R that are relevant to your work and interest
- one possible learning path is to start with the Foundations and move to the other parts and chapters from there

- only a few of the more difficult exercises in the book were solved in one session. It was often a mix of re-reading the question, checking up on the related "Advanced R" section and starting to write some first code and consulting the documentation.
source code/ googling
- luckily at times things were also simpler, than they first seemed.
- Reading base R source code can be intimidating (F2 ("Go to Function") in Rstudio was such a treat :-D)

review your solutions
avoid getting stuck

In a flexible language there will always be many solutions to a problem and the solutions in this book are no exception.

You may also be interested in the [R4DS Advanced R Bookclub](https://GitHub.com/r4ds/bookclub-Advanced_R), where a different chapters of the textbook are discussed with other programmers every week.

### Hadleys role in the process
- Hadley reviewed them
- thanks to Hadley for providing timely reviews (and giving us a good feeling with regard to the correctness of the exercises)
  - It wasn't Hadley who provided the exercises and if there should be errors in the book, they are on us...

### What other skills may be useful do develop as an R developper
We don't necessarily apply many of the concepts taught in Advanced R in daily programming and that's okay! But we hope that the code we write has become more robust, expressive and readable and it's actually quite easy to see the progress, when we take a look at the earlier drafts.

- reading source code is so helpful. just go to GitHub and read the source code of packages you love and developers you admire. you don't have to understand everything, but keeping this a regular practice (for a while) will expose you to many new ideas, patterns and design choices and also expand your R vocabulary.

## Closing remarks
- a project actually neither of us really had the time for. :-D
- so good to collaborate

We are happy to be part of R community. It's fun to build and share and the various backgrounds represented make the exchange much more interesting and meaningful. Much of this success is possible, because R is free software. At least in theory everyone can contribute and no one can take away your freedom to do so.

The rapid adoption data-driven processes in business and technology do affect our everyday lives and societies.

for the things we build with these powerful tools are not neutral. 

We care about this and we decided to support a small initiative, so our small contribution can make more of a difference.

Again, thank you for your interest in this project and we hope the solutions will be of value to you

You may also be interested checking out the first edition of Advanced R as well, which covers base R in much more detail. Some additional solutions related that edition can be found at https://advanced-r-solutions-ed1.netlify.app/

## Acknowledgements
Any open source project is actually the result of the work of a lot of people. We would like to explicitly mention and thank everybody who contributed solutions, raised questions or helped fix spelling and grammar.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
contributors <- paste0(
  "`@", sort(unique(read.csv("contributors.csv")$username)), "`"
)

cat(paste0(contributors, collapse = ", "))

Thanks to CRC Press for the interest in the project our editors Rob Calver and Vaishali Singh for their patience and support

Thanks you to our managers and companies for granting us flexibility with regards to holidays to supporting the completion of this project.

## Conventions
A brief overview of conventions we followed and decisions we made.
- To spice things up a little the book we will sometimes reference Advanced R as a â€žtextbook"
- Some chapters in Advanced R do not contain exercises and in our book you will see that we skipped these chapters. We did this to keep the chapters numbers in this book match those of Advance R.
- We tried to follow the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) as much as possible (shout out to `{styler}` for making this easier to achieve).
- Bookdown will render each chapter in a separate R session. Initially each chapter will load the `{magrittr}` package to unlock the pipe operator, set a random seed to improve reproducibility and set a few ggplot and knitr options. You can check out the (respective code)[https://GitHub.com/Tazinho/Advanced-R-Solutions/blob/main/common.R] on GitHub.
- We chose to to keep the code in this book as self-contained as possible. The packages used will be loaded in the beginning of each chapter. By default we will include all code necessary for the examples. When some longer code passages (from the textbook) were omitted this will be stated explicitly.


## (Omissions)
This book is how we ended up actually writing a book with and about R.

The solutions reflect our learning path of working through the book and we've become more experienced R users and developers throughout this process.
