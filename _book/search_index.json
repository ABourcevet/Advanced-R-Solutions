(Hint: why is it different from x[NA_real_]?) What does upper.tri() return? How does subsetting a matrix with it work? Do we need any additional subsetting rules to describe its behaviour? x &lt;- outer(1:5, 1:5, FUN = “*“) x[upper.tri(x)] Why does mtcars[1:20] return an error? How does it differ from the similar mtcars[1:20, ]? Implement your own function that extracts the diagonal entries from a matrix (it should behave like diag(x) where x is a matrix). What does df[is.na(df)] &lt;- 0 do? How does it work? 3.2 Subsetting operators Given a linear model, e.g., mod &lt;- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars), extract the residual degrees of freedom. Extract the R squared from the model summary (summary(mod)) 3.3 Applications How would you randomly permute the columns of a data frame? (This is an important technique in random forests.) Can you simultaneously permute the rows and columns in one step? How would you select a random sample of m rows from a data frame? What if the sample had to be contiguous (i.e., with an initial row, a final row, and every row in between)? How could you put the columns in a data frame in alphabetical order? "]
